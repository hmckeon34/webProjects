  <h1>Lawrence Hydropower</h1>

  <h2>Part A: History of Lawrence Hydropower</h2>

  <p>
    In 1874, residents of Lawrence, Kansas had burned all of the region’s
    available wood, and fossil fuels were not yet accessible. To address
    this problem, Orlando Darling built a dam across the Kansas River north
    of town and ran mechanical cables from a water wheel to power local
    industries.
  </p>

  <p>
    Justin Bowersock later purchased the operation and named it
    <dfn>The Bowersock Mills &amp; Power Company</dfn> (Bowersock). The
    company’s slogan reflects its long-standing mission:
  </p>

  <blockquote>

      Producing clean, renewable hydropower since 1874
    </a>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Part B: Expansion and Modern Operation</h2>

  <p>
    By 1885, twelve water wheels powered two flouring mills, a paper mill,
    two elevators, a twine factory, a shirt factory, two machine shops, the
    Leis Chemical Works, two printing offices, the barbed wire works, and
    several other smaller industries. After rebuilding from severe ice
    damage in 1888, Bowersock introduced four dynamos that converted raw
    mechanical power into electrical energy.
  </p>

  <p>
    To supplement the original 2.4 megawatt plant on the south side of the
    river, Bowersock later constructed a new 4.6 megawatt plant on the
    north side. To finance this expansion, Bowersock signed a 25-year
    power-purchase agreement with Kansas City’s Board of Public Utilities
    (BPU), requiring that:
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>
      Bowersock must send BPU an annual average power output greater than or
      equal to 80% of its total generating capacity.
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Instantaneous power generation is proportional to the water flow rate
    multiplied by the difference in water height. Because river flow varies
    with rainfall, the amount of power delivered also fluctuates. To
    maximize deliverable energy, Bowersock employs a run-of-the-river
    policy, maintaining the upstream water level as high as possible while
    using whatever flow is available.
  </p>

  <p>
    Energy is stored in the height of the upstream water behind the dam. By
    intentionally varying this height, Bowersock could theoretically use
    stored energy to offset changes in local power consumption or
    renewable generation. However, doing so could violate its contractual
    obligations.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>
      Until the BPU contract ends, energy stored in the water behind the dam
      is not available to Lawrence.
