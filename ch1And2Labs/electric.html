  <h1>Electric Power History</h1>
  <h2>Brief History of Electric Power</h2>

  <p>
    Thomas Edison’s first electric power plant generated 110-volt direct
    current (DC) for lighting and variable-speed machinery in nearby
    buildings. However, efficient transmission of power over long distances
    requires higher voltages. At the time, the only way to transform DC
    voltage was to use a “genset,” which consisted of a DC motor driving a
    DC generator. This setup required two rotating machines and four
    windings, making it complex and inefficient.

    Nikola Tesla later invented the alternating current (AC) induction motor
    and transformer. With a constant AC frequency, an induction motor’s
    speed cannot vary, but it is cheaper and more durable than a DC motor.
    Additionally, a transformer has no moving parts and only two windings,
    making it more efficient and reliable than a DC genset. As a result,
    AC power won the “war of the currents” at the dawn of the 20th century.

    This dominance did not last forever. In the middle of the 20th century,
    computers began consuming increasing amounts of DC power. The invention
    of the insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) and the voltage-source
    converter (VSC) made it possible to efficiently convert and control
    electrical power. A VSC can generate variable-frequency AC, allowing
    induction motors to run at variable speeds, and it can easily transform
    DC power.

    Today, DC power, computer control, and the internet are helping the power
    grid integrate variable renewable resources such as wind and solar
    energy. These technologies are also improving electrical distribution
    systems on campuses, in neighborhoods, and within buildings. With the
    addition of local energy generation and storage, distribution systems
    are evolving into robust systems known as microgrids.
