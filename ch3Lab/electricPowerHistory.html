    <h2>Brief History of Electric Power</h2>
    <p>
      Thomas Edison’s first electric power plant generated 110-volt direct current for lighting and variable-speed machinery in nearby buildings. The system worked well for small areas but could not easily transmit power over long distances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nikola Tesla later invented the alternating current induction motor and transformer. With a constant AC frequency, transformers made it possible to transmit power at high voltage and low current, then step it down for safe local use.
    </p>
    <p>
      This breakthrough allowed electric power systems to expand rapidly across cities and regions. Large centralized power plants became practical, and electricity became a common utility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, modern power systems combine traditional generation with renewable resources such as wind and solar, along with advanced control systems and power electronics.
