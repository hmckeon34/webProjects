    <h2>History of Lawrence Hydropower</h2>
    <p>
      In 1874, residents of Lawrence, Kansas had burned all the region’s wood, and fossil fuels were not available. Orlando Darling built a dam across the Kansas River and used mechanical power from a water wheel to run local industries.

      Justin Bowersock later purchased the operation and named it The Bowersock Mills and Power Company. The company focused on providing reliable energy to support the growth of Lawrence.

    <p>
      Producing clean, renewable hydropower since 1874.
    </p>
    <p>
      By 1885, twelve water wheels powered mills, factories, and machine shops. After rebuilding from ice damage in 1888, Bowersock introduced dynamos that converted mechanical power into electrical energy.

      Today, the Bowersock plant continues to operate and remains an important example of long-term renewable energy production in Kansas.
